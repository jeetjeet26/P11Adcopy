REAL ESTATE AD COPY IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=======================================================

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
- Current ad copy generation produces irrelevant content that doesn't leverage rich client data
- Generic vector search queries miss specific brand voice, demographics, and property features
- Client intake data and uploaded documents (psychographic analysis) are underutilized
- No intelligent synthesis of multiple data sources

AVAILABLE RICH DATA SOURCES:
1. Vector Chunks (45 chunks): Psychographic analysis, demographics, lifestyle patterns, area details
2. Client Intake Data: Brand voice guidelines, target audience, unique features, competitors
3. Property Context: Location, unit details, pricing, special offers

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
===================

PHASE 1: INTELLIGENT CONTEXT RETRIEVAL
--------------------------------------
Priority: HIGH | Timeline: 1-2 weeks

1.1 Multi-Query Vector Search System
   - Replace single generic query with 4 specialized queries:
     * Brand voice & messaging query
     * Target demographic & psychographic query  
     * Property features & amenities query
     * Local area & lifestyle query
   
1.2 Context Categorization Engine
   - Classify retrieved chunks by type:
     * Brand guidelines & voice
     * Target demographic profiles
     * Property amenities & features
     * Local area insights
     * Competitor intelligence
   
1.3 Enhanced buildSearchQuery() Function
   - Create generateMultipleQueries() function
   - Implement chunk classification logic
   - Add relevance scoring for chunk prioritization

PHASE 2: STRUCTURED CONTEXT SYNTHESIS  
------------------------------------
Priority: HIGH | Timeline: 2-3 weeks

2.1 Client Profile Builder
   - Combine intake data + vector chunks into structured profile
   - Create ClientProfileManager class
   - Implement data validation and fallback logic

2.2 Campaign Context Generator
   - Create campaign-specific context aligned with ad group type
   - Implement CampaignContextBuilder class
   - Add context relevance scoring

2.3 Brand Voice Enforcer
   - Parse and structure brand voice guidelines
   - Create BrandVoiceValidator class
   - Ensure consistency with established guidelines

PHASE 3: ENHANCED PROMPT ENGINEERING
-----------------------------------
Priority: MEDIUM | Timeline: 1-2 weeks

3.1 Contextual Prompt Structure
   - Restructure generateRealEstatePrompt() with clear sections:
     * Brand voice guidelines section
     * Target demographic insights section
     * Property/location unique selling points
     * Competitor differentiation points
     * Campaign-specific requirements

3.2 Example-Driven Generation
   - Include successful ad copy examples matching brand voice
   - Add template-based generation for consistency
   - Implement dynamic example selection

3.3 Advanced Context Integration
   - Better integration of psychographic insights
   - Competitor-aware messaging
   - Location-specific value propositions

PHASE 4: VALIDATION & QUALITY CONTROL
------------------------------------
Priority: MEDIUM | Timeline: 2-3 weeks

4.1 Brand Alignment Validation
   - Create BrandAlignmentScorer class
   - Validate against brand voice guidelines
   - Implement automated feedback scoring

4.2 Demographic Relevance Checker
   - Ensure messaging resonates with target audience
   - Add psychographic alignment validation
   - Create DemographicRelevanceValidator

4.3 Competitive Differentiation Analysis
   - Highlight unique advantages vs competitors
   - Add CompetitorAnalyzer class
   - Ensure positioning differentiation

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
===============================

File Structure Changes:
----------------------
/lib/context/
  - MultiQueryGenerator.ts
  - ChunkClassifier.ts  
  - ClientProfileBuilder.ts
  - CampaignContextBuilder.ts
  - BrandVoiceValidator.ts

/lib/validation/
  - BrandAlignmentScorer.ts
  - DemographicRelevanceValidator.ts
  - CompetitorAnalyzer.ts

Enhanced Functions:
------------------
1. buildSearchQuery() → generateMultipleQueries()
2. generateRealEstatePrompt() → enhanced with structured sections
3. New: classifyChunks()
4. New: buildClientProfile()
5. New: validateBrandAlignment()

Database Enhancements:
---------------------
- Add context_quality_score to campaigns table
- Add brand_alignment_score to campaigns table  
- Create campaign_context_sources table for tracking

Key Implementation Steps:
========================

STEP 1: Multi-Query Vector Search (Week 1)
- Implement generateMultipleQueries() function
- Create 4 specialized query generators
- Test with existing AMLI data

STEP 2: Chunk Classification (Week 1-2)  
- Build ChunkClassifier with type detection
- Implement relevance scoring algorithm
- Create structured chunk organization

STEP 3: Client Profile Integration (Week 2-3)
- Build ClientProfileBuilder class
- Integrate intake data with vector chunks
- Create structured client context objects

STEP 4: Enhanced Prompt Engineering (Week 3-4)
- Restructure generateRealEstatePrompt()
- Add brand voice enforcement
- Include demographic-specific messaging

STEP 5: Validation Framework (Week 4-6)
- Implement brand alignment scoring
- Add demographic relevance validation
- Create quality control pipeline

STEP 6: Testing & Refinement (Week 6-8)
- A/B test prompt variations
- Validate with real client data
- Implement feedback loops

SUCCESS METRICS:
===============
- Brand voice alignment score > 8/10
- Demographic relevance score > 8/10  
- Client satisfaction with ad copy relevance
- Reduced need for manual copy editing
- Improved click-through rates on generated ads

DEPENDENCIES:
============
- OpenAI API access
- Supabase vector database
- Client intake form completion
- Brand voice documentation upload

RISK MITIGATION:
===============
- Fallback to current system if new system fails
- Gradual rollout with A/B testing
- Manual review process during transition
- Client feedback integration mechanisms
