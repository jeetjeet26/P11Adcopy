# System Prompt Improvement Plan - Reference Document

## **Executive Summary**
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to improve system prompts in the real estate campaign generation system, focusing on clarity, reliability, and reduced complexity.

---

## **Core Issues Identified**

### **1. Prompt Complexity**
- Current prompts exceed 1000+ characters
- Multiple competing instructions within single prompts
- LLM cognitive overload leading to degraded performance

### **2. Priority Conflicts**
- **RESOLVED**: Unit type campaigns now have clear hierarchy
- Conflicting "MUST" vs "SHOULD" instructions eliminated
- Character counting reliability issues

### **3. Technical Reliability**
- JSON extraction fragility
- Google Maps API over-dependency
- Character validation post-processing issues

---

## **Revised Campaign Priority Hierarchies**

### **UNIT TYPE CAMPAIGNS** ‚úÖ
```
Priority 1 (REQUIRED): Include unit type in EVERY headline
- Examples: "Studio", "1-Bedroom", "2-Bedroom", "3-Bedroom"
Priority 2: Include amenities as character space allows
Community Name: OPTIONAL (not required)
```

### **PROXIMITY CAMPAIGNS**
```
Priority 1: Include specific place names from Google Maps
Priority 2: Focus on convenience/accessibility benefits  
Community Name: NOT USED (pure location focus)
```

### **GENERAL LOCATION CAMPAIGNS**
```
Priority 1: Community name in 40% of headlines (6/15)
Priority 2: Amenities in 60% of headlines (9/15)
Priority 3: Balance branding with features
```

---

## **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Core Restructuring** (Week 1-2)
- [x] Remove character counting from prompts
- [x] Simplify unit type requirements (unit type required, community optional)
- [x] Reduce proximity campaign from 8 to 3 steps
- [x] Standardize JSON output requirements

### **Phase 2: Template Creation** (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Create modular prompt components
- [ ] Implement staged correction approach
- [ ] Reduce prompt lengths to 600-700 chars
- [ ] Add specific headline distribution rules

### **Phase 3: Optimization** (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Fine-tune campaign modules
- [ ] Optimize Google Maps integration
- [ ] Create comprehensive fallbacks
- [ ] Performance testing

---

## **New Prompt Template Structure**

### **Base Template**
```
üéØ CAMPAIGN: [Type] - [Location]
üìù REQUIREMENTS: 15 headlines (~25 chars), 4 descriptions (~75 chars)
üé® FOCUS: [Campaign-specific priority]
üìä OUTPUT: JSON only
```

### **Character Strategy**
- **Remove**: All character counting instructions from prompts
- **Use**: Range-based targets ("about 25 characters")
- **Rely on**: Post-generation validation entirely

---

## **Campaign-Specific Improvements**

### **Unit Type Campaigns**
```
‚úÖ SIMPLIFIED REQUIREMENTS:
- Every headline MUST contain unit type
- Community name is optional
- Amenities as space allows
- NO conflicting priorities
```

### **Proximity Campaigns**
```
‚úÖ STREAMLINED PROCESS:
Step 1: Get Google Maps data (3 location types)
Step 2: Create headlines with place names
Step 3: Focus on convenience benefits
```

### **General Location Campaigns**
```
‚úÖ CLEAR DISTRIBUTION:
- 9 amenity-focused headlines
- 6 community-branded headlines
- Clear 60/40 split
```

---

## **Technical Improvements**

### **JSON Reliability**
- Consistent schema across campaigns
- Explicit validation requirements
- Better error recovery

### **Correction Strategy**
- Stage 1: Fix headline lengths only
- Stage 2: Fix description lengths only  
- Stage 3: Fix content issues if needed

### **Validation Metrics**
- Target: 90%+ character validation accuracy
- Target: <5% JSON parsing failures
- Target: 85%+ correction success rate

---

## **Key Decisions Made**

### **Unit Type Campaign Clarity** ‚úÖ
- **DECISION**: Unit type required in every headline
- **DECISION**: Community name optional (removes conflict)
- **RATIONALE**: Eliminates priority conflicts, increases targeting precision

### **Character Count Strategy** ‚úÖ
- **DECISION**: Remove all character counting from prompts
- **DECISION**: Use descriptive ranges instead of exact counts
- **RATIONALE**: LLMs cannot reliably count characters

### **Proximity Campaign Simplification** ‚úÖ
- **DECISION**: Reduce from 8 steps to 3 steps
- **DECISION**: Remove complex categorization
- **RATIONALE**: Over-engineering leads to failures
